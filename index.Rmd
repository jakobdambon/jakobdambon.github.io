Let Me Introduce Myself 
-----------------------------------

I am a statistician and PhD candidate in Biostatistics at the *University of Zurich* (UZH), Switzerland. My research interests lie in spatial and spatio-temporal statistics, both with frequentest and Bayesian approaches. My supervisor is [Prof. Dr. Reinhard Furrer](https://www.math.uzh.ch/index.php?id=people&id=people&key1=4087&L=1) from the Institute of Mathematics, UZH. In joint work with the *Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts* (HSLU), I am currently working on modelling house market prizes. Here, my supervisor is [Dr. Fabio Sigrist](https://www.hslu.ch/en/lucerne-university-of-applied-sciences-and-arts/about-us/people-finder/profile/?pid=3064).

Furthermore, I am a research assistant at the *Lucerne School of Business* which is part of HSLU. I work on projects covering Data Analytics, statistical analysis and implementations of Machine Learning methods. I share my experience with colleagues at the Machine Learning Clinic and Spatial Data Analytics expert group organized by the Swiss Alliance for Data-Intensive Services.

I am an [R](https://www.r-project.org/) enthusiast and an active participant at the Zurich R User Group meet-ups.
