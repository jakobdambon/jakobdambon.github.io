Let Me Introduce Myself 
-----------------------------------

I am a statistician and PhD candidate in Biostatistics at the University of Zurich (UZH), Switzerland. My research interests lie in spatial and spatio-temporal statistics, both with frequentist and Bayesian approaches. My supervisor is Prof. Dr. Reinhard Furrer from the Institute of Mathematics, UZH. In joint work with the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts (HSLU), I am currently working on modelling house market prizes. Here, my supervisor is Dr. Fabio Sigrist.

Furthermore, I am a research assistant at the Lucerne School of Business, Switzerland. Here, I work on projects covering Data Analytics, statistical analysis and implemenations of Machine Learning methods. I share my experience with colleagues at the Machine Learning Clinic organized by the Swiss Alliance for Data-Intensive Services.

I am an R enthusiast and an active participant at the Zurich R User Group meet-ups.
